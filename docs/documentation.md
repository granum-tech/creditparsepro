## About

Are you struggling to leverage credit report data effectively for analytics and machine learning? Many loan origination systems provide credit report data in a cumbersome, fixed-format text. This not only hampers your ability to perform in-depth analysis but also requires navigating through extensive documentation and complex logic to parse the data.

Introducing our API solution â€“ the bridge to transforming traditional credit report data into a dynamic format ready for advanced fintech applications. Our software parses curated fields for both analytics and machine learning use-cases in a ready-to-use JSON format.

Unlock the full potential of your data with our API, and step into a new era of financial technology applications. Say goodbye to outdated processes and embrace a future where your data works for you, enabling faster, more accurate decision-making.

## Support

Please contact us at [info@creditparsepro.io](mailto:info@creditparsepro.io) for suppoer and inquiries.


## **Authentication**

Authenticate each request by including the request header `x-api-key`. This was sent to you via Email when signing up.

It is okay to share your API key within your organization as there are no seat limits imposed only rate and quota limits.

In the case that a key is lost please email us from the email used to signup at info@creditparsepro.io.

If an API key is missing, malformed, or invalid, you will receive an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response code.


## **Quota & Rate Limits**

API access rate and quota limits apply at a per-API key basis in unit time. The rate and quota you are offered depends on the product subscription tier that you chose. If you would like to upgrade you can do so at any time in the [Stripe billing portal](https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/14kaHj8NX5LJ5Ta8ww). You can see our detailed product offerings on our [website](https://www.creditparsepro.io/pricing).

You can check your current rate and quota limits using the GET requests [GET v1/quota-info](#get-v1quota-info) and [GET v1/rate-info](#get-v1rate-info).

If you either reach your quota or rate limit you will receive a 401 error message.
